# Sasak UI Basic Demo

Demo project for Sasak UI Basic Component.

## Running the application
The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvn spring-boot:run`, then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to set up a development environment for
Vaadin projects](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/install) (Windows, Linux, macOS).

## Deploying to Production
To create a production build, call `mvn clean package -Pproduction`.
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/sasak-ui-basic-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war` (NOTE, replace 
`sasak-ui-basic-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war` with the name of your jar).
